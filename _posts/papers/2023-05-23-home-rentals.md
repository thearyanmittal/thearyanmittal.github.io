A data science project aimed at predicting the prices of home rentals in the Atlanta region. Data was scraped from the Georgia MLS site. After extensive data cleaning and exploratory feature analysis, the performance of various regression models was evaluated, resulting in a final model that accurately predicts home rental prices to within roughly $500.
