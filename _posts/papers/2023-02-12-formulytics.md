Formulytics is a live Formula 1 race visualizer that only requires lap time data to function. Formulytics also uses this data to predict the expected finish position of each racer through an original neural network and send live updates for your favorite racer through text. Won "Best Sports Project" and $500 in prizes at Hacklytics 2023 (Data Science @ Georgia Tech's signature 36 hour hackathon with over 400 participants).
