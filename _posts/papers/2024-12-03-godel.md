There is a fundamental hole in logic: no system of math can be both free of contradictions and able to prove every statement. This presentation goes through the background of math's Foundational Crisis, the proofs of Gödel's two incompleteness theorems, and the implications of the results. This was my final project for Georgia Tech's CS 4510: Automata & Complexity.
