This lightning talk caps a semester's worth of study on methods of solving diophantine equations (equations whose solutions of interest are integers) often encountered in competition math. This was done as part of Georgia Tech's Spring 2023 School of Math Directed Reading Program under the mentorship of Topto Kittisut.
