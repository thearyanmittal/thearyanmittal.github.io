A remote-controlled vehicle modeled after an M4 Sherman. A large console (surrounding the base of a chair) with two levers and two foot pedals was constructed to remotely control The Tank using real-life tank controls as opposed to a handheld remote. The Tank mimicked the driving capability of a real tank, fired a 1 mW laser beam, and sent live 720p60 video from an onboard camera to a publically-accessible web server.

This project was made during the 2021 Georgia Governor's Honors Program (GHP 58) and presented at the GHP 58 Engineering Expo.
