A solution for reducing damage claims at UPS by detecting package damage via installed cameras in fulfillment centers. A computer vision model achieves 92% accuracy in detecting damage and feeds this data to an interactive analytics dashboard that tracks geographical and chronological trends, helping UPS identify supply chain trouble spots early.

This project was awarded 1st place by Google Cloud and 2nd place overall at the 2023 UPS Technology Hackathon.
