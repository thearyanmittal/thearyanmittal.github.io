permalink: lrmc-rankings/

At the start of the 2025 NCAA football season, this page will hold up-to-date team rankings based on a variation of the logistic regression/Markov chain model originally described by [Kvam and Sokol](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nav.20170) and adapted for college football by [Kolbush and Sokol](https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/ijcss-2017-0014). This page will show the LRMC rankings generated by calibrating the model using the metrics experimented with in my [NFL team power ranking](/projects/nfl-lrmc) project.
